    "*In general, Charter Schools offered the best value in terms of Cost of Eductation.  Charter schools spent an average of \\\\$599.50 per student with an overall passing rate of 95.10%.  District schools spent more on average (\\\\$643.57 per student) with an average passing rate of 73.67%. <br><br>\n",
    "*The schools with a spending range of \\\\$600-\\\\$625 per student yielded the highets overall passing rate of 95.27%.  There was a nearly 20% decrease in overall passing rate (77.28) when spending \\\\$625-$650 per student.  This follows with the trend that Large schools experience a similar drop off in overall passing rate (95.20% for medium compared to 76.36% for large), suggesting that the drop off in performance is may be related to the size of the school versus the spending rates.<br><br>\n",
    "*Overall, math seems to be the more challenging subject for all students, in all grades, in all school types.<br>\n",
